#### **4. Customers Who Never Order [Easy]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/description/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i
```

##### **Description**
```
- there are 2 methods:
	- 1. Using Sub Queries
	- 2. Using Join:
	* refer join visualization in case you don't understand Joins: https://joins.spathon.com/
	* We perform join because they have common column which is referring to Customer ID
	* refer the above given link and then see this diagram for this example:
		Customers table:
		+----+-------+
		| id | name  |
		+----+-------+
		| 1  | Joe   |
		| 2  | Henry |
		| 3  | Sam   |
		| 4  | Max   |
		+----+-------+
		Orders table:
		+----+------------+
		| id | customerId |
		+----+------------+
		| 1  | 3          |
		| 2  | 1          |
		+----+------------+
		
		* According to the diagram we want 2, 4 and we can get it by left join
```

##### **Code for SUB QUERIES**
```sql
SELECT name as Customers from Customers
WHERE id NOT IN(SELECT customerId from Orders)
```

##### **Code for LEFT JOIN**:
```sql
SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers C
LEFT JOIN Orders O
ON C.id = O.customerId 
WHERE O.id is NULL;
```

##### **Comparison**
* For Lesser values, both Joins and sub queries method might perform the same way
* But for Larger amount of values, **Joins are preferrable** over Nested/Sub Queries
* [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-vs-subquery/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-vs-subquery/), You can refer this for detailed comparison between Joins vs Sub-Queries

#### **7. Delete duplicate Emails [Easy]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i
```
â€‹
##### **Description**
```
- there are 2 methods in cartesian product/cross join and normal join
- in this case both of them would ideally give similar performance
- but in case of dissimilar tables normal join is always preferred over cross join 
- as it would create a lot more rows ie., m*n rows are generated

```
##### **Code for Cartesian Product**
```sql
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND
p1.id > p2.id
```

##### **Code for Normal Join**
```sql
DELETE p1 from Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON P1.email = p2.email p
WHERE p1.id > p2.id;
```

#### **15. Combine two tables [Easy]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i
```

##### **Description**
```
- simple left join query
```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state 
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId
```

â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”â†”


#### **16. Customers who visited by did not make any transactions [Easy]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/description/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i
```

##### **Description**
##### Showing by breaking the queries stepwise:

1. firstly perform LEFT JOIN and see what it returns
- **code v1:** 
 ```sql
    SELECT v.customer_id, amount 
    FROM Visits v 
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
```
- Result of above query for example given in problem:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0021fe14-baea-42c2-ab5b-39bd4b3100b2_1676602187.672864.png)

2. add "count" in the select statement

- **count is always accompanied with group by clause!!**
- **When count is not accompanied by group by, it returns no. of rows in the table**
- we want to group by it wrt to the customer_id, right?
- code v2:
 ```sql
    SELECT v.customer_id, count(customer_id) as count_no_trans
    FROM Visits v 
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
    GROUP BY v.customer_id
```
- result of above query:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5e7fdb01-506a-4c9a-934b-e3f8a1f370ee_1676602572.1498237.png)

3. adding the condition "users who visited without making any transactions"
- we were counting all the entries by grouping by wrt to customer_id  
- now we are adding the given condition
- see the output of code v1, you will see that we got null is some of the values
- the "null" represents that there were no values in transaction table corresponding to the visit_id in visits table
- and that is what we want!!!
> **remember while using WHERE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY in the same query, below is the order in which this should be used!! 
    where
    group by
    order by**
- code:
```sql
    SELECT v.customer_id, count(v.customer_id) as count_no_trans
    FROM Visits v 
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
    WHERE t.amount is NULL
    GROUP BY v.customer_id
```
	
##### **Code**
```sql
	SELECT v.customer_id, count(v.customer_id) as count_no_trans
    FROM Visits v 
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
    WHERE t.amount is NULL
    GROUP BY v.customer_id
```

#### **18. Rising Temperature [Easy but not Easy]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/description/
```

##### **Description**
```
- To compare one date with the previous date, there is no direct provision 
- we can apply inner join on the recordDate such that w1.RecordDate - 1 = w2.RecordDate
- but keep this in mind that we can simply add the dates because adding 1 to  2022-12-31 
  wont be giving 2023-01-01, so we need to use in-built function **TO_DAYS**
```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT w1.id as Id
FROM Weather w1
INNER JOIN Weather w2
ON TO_DAYS(w1.recordDate) - 1 = TO_DAYS(w2.recordDate)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature

##### **Description**
```
- We need to do 3 things:
1. according to activity date we need to count how many times a user appeared 
	on that date, basically count(user_id), grouped by activity_date
2. check the activity_date constraints where it should lie from '2019-06-28'
	to '2019-07-29' ie., span of 30 days
3. update the columns names
```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT activity_date as day,
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date >= '2019-06-28' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-29'
GROUP BY activity_date

#### **27. Capital Gain/Loss [Medium]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/capital-gainloss/
```

##### **Description**
```
- Problem is based on using aggregate function based on condition
- General logic is that if the stock is in 'Buy' state then the money will be deducted
  and i fit is 'sell' state money will be added
 - This will be grouped by the name of stocks
 - so, we have added a IF condition inside SUM such that if it is 'Buy' state, 
   we will do -= price, else we will += price
```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT stock_name, 
SUM(IF(operation = 'Buy', -price, price)) as capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```

#### **29. Market Analysis I [Medium]**
##### **Link**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/market-analysis-i/description/
```
##### **Description**
```
Q1: Why did we use Left Join?
- Because we wanted the orders by users ie., we want a buyer_id corresponding to the user_id
Q2: Why didnt we use WHERE for YEAR(order_date) = 2019
- Remember this: "While we want to filter the Join Product, we use the condition inside WHERE
  But when the condition is part of JOIN operation, we need to put inside ON"
Q3: what will be the difference if we put "YEAR(order_date) = 2019" condition inside WHERE versus inside ON?
- When we put this condition inside WHERE condition, it will completely remove the entries with order_date in the years other than '2019'.
- But when we use it inside ON, we get NULL corresponding tho the entries where order_date is in the years other than '2019'. 
  This way, the entries with no values in the year 2019 wont be completely removed and we can count NULL as 0
```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT user_id as buyer_id,
join_date, 
IFNULL(COUNT(order_date), 0) as orders_in_2019
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id
AND YEAR(order_date) = '2019'
GROUP BY u.user_id

- applying left join on 'account' 
- using the aggregate function SUM we add all the amounts from Transaction table grouping by account number
- since WHERE cannot be used with aggregate functions hence we use HAVING for the condition
```

SELECT name, 
SUM(amount) as balance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
on u.account = t.account
GROUP BY account HAVING balance > 10000

- very similar to previous problem

```
##### **Code**
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, product_name
FROM Product p
LEFT JOIN Sales s
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
